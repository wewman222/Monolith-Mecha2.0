# Shuttle Notes:
# A relatively costly, but very effective science vessel.
# There is some steel placed on it, but in an inconvenient location.
# As a self-respecting scientist, you gotta put in a little work for yourself.
# Aka: you're compelled to salvage at least a TINY bit before starting science
# Which not only means you'll likely get an artifact or more for yourself to work on,
# but you'll inadvertently salvage materials you'll need to inevitably fix the explosions that'll ensue.
#
# One Mercenary slot is left open by default. The ship is intended for more than one person due to the space available.
# It's price is a bit steep, but it's to pay for the (mostly non-reinforced) shuttle walls, and the ample-fine setup.
# The ship has no rear-facing guns by design. The motif for the ship is "form and function";
#   making it look and work good for Science and Salvage. The rest is a courtesy reflected in its price.
