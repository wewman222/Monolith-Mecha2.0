  A Protogen is a technologically enhanced being made of both technological and biological parts. Though they have a mix of artificial and non-artificial organs, they still operate with a soul and mind, yet there are also program files that operate them, and overheating/overcooling can damage the circuits of the artificial organs. They still need to eat and be healed using normal medicines.
