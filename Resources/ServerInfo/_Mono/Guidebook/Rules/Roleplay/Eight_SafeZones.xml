# Roleplay Rule 8
## Safe Zones: Sanctuary and Conduct

[color=green][bold]Safe Zones[/bold][/color] (Colonial Outpost, Medical Dispatch, and a 256m radius around each) are neutral sanctuary areas for all players, regardless of group or affiliation. Their purpose is to provide a secure environment for roleplay, medical treatment, and new player orientation.

[color=red][bold]Prohibited in Safe Zones at all times:[/bold][/color]
- Hostile actions (attacking, raiding, seizing control, starting fights)
- Attempts to disrupt the peace or take ownership of the location

If you cause trouble in a Safe Zone (see above), you forfeit protection and may be detained. [color=yellow][bold]Detained individuals must be handed over to CO Security Guards for processing, not to any faction or group.[/bold][/color]

- [color=yellow][bold]Use non-lethal force for arrests and detainment when practical. If non-lethal options would put you or others at serious risk, using lethal force is acceptable.[/bold][/color]
- [color=yellow][bold]Contraband is discouraged in Safe Zones.[/bold][/color] It is only actionable if used, brandished, or you are causing trouble. Wearing or carrying immediate gear is tolerated; stashing or distributing is not.
- Entering a Safe Zone does not end ongoing fights or consequences. Attempting to abuse Safe Zones to escape or disrupt roleplay may result in administrative action.
