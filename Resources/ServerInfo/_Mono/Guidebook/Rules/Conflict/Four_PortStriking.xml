# Conflict Rule 4
## Outpost striking is not allowed.

Faction outposts (e.g., [color=yellow]Camelot Station[/color]) are [color=red][bold]not allowed[/bold][/color] to be striked until the shift duration has hit [color=yellow]four (4) hours[/color].

[italic][color=yellow]This initial "grace period" is designed to provide factions with a window to establish themselves and engage in roleplay before facing attacks.[/color][/italic]

- For clarity, a "strike" in this context refers to any (organized or unorganized) hostile action intended to damage outposts, seize control, eliminate its occupants, or damage docked ships.

See the [textlink="Safe Zones rule" link="MonolithRuleRoleplayEightSafeZones"] for areas that are always protected from strikes.

[italic][color=green]Respect the grace period to encourage fair play and allow for meaningful faction development.[/color][/italic]
