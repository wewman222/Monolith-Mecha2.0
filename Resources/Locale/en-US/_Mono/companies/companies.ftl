The colonial surge to one of the last surviving plasma worlds in the rogue sector on the edge of space granted substantial sway in the New Galactic Congress’ space, leading to their official recognition as a sovereign entity. GNG itself does not hold elections, and is ruled by an elite class of executives. As their name and origins imply, the GNG’s most profound exports are that of plasma, tritium, and heavy tanker vessels. Their primary trade partners are other members of the NGC.
