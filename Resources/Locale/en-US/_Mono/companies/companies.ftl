dark-matter-enterprises-description = A corporate conglomerate of mercenaries, scientists, physicians, engineers, merchants, contractors, and clowns all of which vary in qualifications, if any. Founded by unhinged ex-Nanotrasen Contractors, DME operates with one goal in mind: Profit. All members of the DME operate towards maximizing profit margins, for themselves alongside subsidiaries under the organization. DME functions under one core tenant called the Golden Rule which states “No infighting between enterprise members as this negatively affects profit margins.”

# aetherion-dynamics-description = Representing the forefront of technological innovation, Aetherion Dynamics is renowned for their invention of the Compressed Gas Launch and Projectile (CGLP) system used in the VX9 turbolaser battery, and additional innovative weapons with little to no consistent philosophy. They have a reputation as high quality rogue space manufacturers and designers with high prices and little to no regulation, making them an appealing company to work for but not to buy from.

southern-peak-mercenaries-description = “A good rogue is a dead rogue.” says the slogan of this vicious mercenary company. The Southern Peaks were formed along the TSF-Rogue space border out retaliation against encroaching pirates and insurgents in combination with a sheer distrust of the TSFMC. Without the need of any other organization, TSP aims to fight back the Rogue Sector on its own.

zealots-of-balaam-description = The Zealots and pilgrims of Balaam are luddites with a extreme aversion to the use of Hi-tech. They are overtly isolationist, preferring to raid convoys that move too far into space. As a follower of the blessed god, work underneath a senior zealot to help them levy their tithes. Never listen to the blasphemy of the other companies. Kill those who profane Balaam's eye with the use of shield tech and FTL, heavy industry is not safe either.
